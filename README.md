# ReactJS-ToDoList (Forked & Extended)

## Introduction

This project is a **forked and extended** version of a Front-End To-Do List web application, originally created by [Matheus Cavini](https://github.com/MatheusCavini). 

I am integrating this front-end with my own **NestJS + GraphQL + PostgreSQL backend**, adding authentication and persistent task management.

The original project was a **Front-End study only**, without authentication or a database. My goal is to **extend it into a full-stack application** while keeping the clean UI design intact.

## Original Repository

## Features (Updated)

âœ… **Full-Stack Integration:** Connected to a NestJS GraphQL backend with PostgreSQL.  
âœ… **Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their tasks securely.  
âœ… **Persistent Task Storage:** Tasks are stored in a PostgreSQL database instead of temporary local state.  
âœ… **Existing Frontend Features:**  
- Login page with authentication.  
- To-Do list UI with sidebar navigation.  
- Task creation, completion, deletion, and filtering.
